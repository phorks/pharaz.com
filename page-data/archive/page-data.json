Since \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"personInstance\"), \" is defined inside the \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"main\"), \" method, it cannot be accessed elsewhere, hence, the lambda expression will capture the \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"personInstance\"), \" object and store it inside a compiler-generated class as a field named \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"personInstance\"), \". So \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"personInstance\"), \" object is a property inside an implicit compiler-generated class. As a result \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Expression\"), \" property of the member expression, in this case, is also a \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"MemberExpression\"), \" with its \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Member\"), \" property being a \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"MemberInfo\"), \" with \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"personInstance\"), \" name and its \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Expression\"), \" being a \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"ConstantExpression\"), \" that has that compiler-generated class as its value.
